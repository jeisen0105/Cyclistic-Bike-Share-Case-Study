# Cyclistic

## Introduction
In this project I will be examining the Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study which is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I will examine this case study using the different steps I learned from the course including; to ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. 

## Background
Cycalistic is a bike share program in Chicago that features 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations across the city. What separates Cyclistic and other bike sharing companies is that they don't only have customary bicycles they also carry cyclistic bicycles. Cyclystic biscycles include reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes. These options make bike sharing more inclusive to those with disabilities or those who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. Cyclystics' vast array of different bicycles and stations allow citizens to travel conveniently throughout the city and with ease.

In addition to offering Cyclystic bikes, Cyclystic also maintains flexibility in their pricing plans. Cyclystic offers single-ride pass, full-day pass and annual memberships illustrating the company's effort to appeal to broad consumer segments. These changes are important to implement however Cyclystics marketing director believes that by maximizing the number of annual memberships the company will succeed in the future. In order to fully understand how to maximize annual memberships, we must first differentiate between casual riders (those who use the app without a membership) and our annual members. Through analyzing what separates the two groups I can help Cyclystic design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
